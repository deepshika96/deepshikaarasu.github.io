## About

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience at <a href="https://www.poietis.com" target="_blank">Poietis Ltd</a> under the Marie Curie Fellowship Program,  <a href="https://www.asctn-training.net" target="_blank" >ASCTN</a>. I am passionate about using biology and harnessing technology to implement solutions in the field of healthcare. Broadly, I am interested in science, technology, and equality and how these aspects together impact the real world. A look at my timeline discusses my academic trajectory over the past few years. I am also the COO of <a href="https://www.msaaw.in" target="_blank">My Story As A (Wo)man</a>, an NGO that address trauma faced by womxn in India. If not discussing science or feminism, you can find me cooking spicy food, watercolour painting and delving into netflix releases. "Deepshika" in Sanskrit translates to "the light of a flame from a lamp", it signifies the presence of light as knowledge and truly, I get the greatest joy in pursuing knowledge, analyzing and discussing it.
