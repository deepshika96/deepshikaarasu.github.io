## About

"Deepshika" in Sanskrit translates to "the light of a flame from a lamp", it signifies the presence of light as knowledge and truly; I derive the greatest joy in pursuing knowledge, analyzing and discussing it. 

I am currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.poietis.com" target="_blank">Poietis Ltd</a> under the Marie Curie 
Fellowship Program,  <a href="https://www.asctn-training.net" target="_blank" >ASCTN</a>. I am passionate about biology and harnessing engineering technology to implement solutions in healthcare. Broadly, I am interested in science, technology, policy and how these aspects synergitically impact the real world. I have had the opportunity to travel around the world during the course of my training, which informs my interest in understanding cultures. I am also the COO of <a href="https://www.msaaw.in" target="_blank">My Story As A (Wo)man</a>, an NGO that addresses trauma faced by womxn in India. If not discussing science or feminism, 
you can find me sampling different cuisines, watercolour painting or reading the latest Goodread release.
